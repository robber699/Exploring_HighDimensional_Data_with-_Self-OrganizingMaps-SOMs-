## SOM Classification on Dry Bean Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of a classification project using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) on the Dry Bean dataset. The goal of the project was to explore the effectiveness of SOMs in classifying different types of dry beans based on a variety of features.

### Summary

In this project, we utilized the Dry Bean dataset to train and test various Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for classification purposes. The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed for attributes such as size, value ranges, and correlations before applying SOMs. We tested different SOM configurations, including variations in initialization, map size, neighborhood radius, and learning rates, to determine the optimal settings for classification. The results were analyzed to assess the impact on class distribution, quantization errors, and cluster stability. The experiment demonstrated the ability of SOMs to effectively classify dry beans, with various configurations yielding insights into the relationship between the classes and clusters.

This project was part of a university course focused on Self-Organizing Systems. Throughout the project, we applied theoretical concepts in a practical setting, testing different approaches to optimize the SOM for classification tasks.
