# Project Overview: Optimizing Self-Organizing Maps for Dry Bean Classification

This project, developed as part of a university course, focuses on the classification of different types of dry beans using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). The dataset used for this analysis is the Dry Bean Dataset, which consists of various features related to the physical properties of different dry bean types.

The primary objective was to explore the effectiveness of SOMs in classifying high-dimensional data. Throughout the project, we systematically experimented with several key SOM parameters to understand their impact on classification accuracy and the quality of the resulting map. Specifically, we varied the map size, neighborhood radius, and learning rates to observe how these factors influence the clustering of data points and the overall performance of the SOM.

Additionally, we analyzed the effects of different initialization methods and scaling techniques to optimize the SOM for the task at hand. The results highlighted the importance of fine-tuning SOM parameters to achieve high-quality mapping, with particular attention to maintaining topological relationships and minimizing quantization errors.

This project not only demonstrates the power of SOMs in classification tasks but also provides valuable insights into how different configurations can affect the outcome of machine learning experiments. The findings and methods developed here can serve as a foundation for future work in the area of unsupervised learning and data visualization.
